### Challenges in Handwriting Recognition

1. Huge variability and ambiguity of strokes from person to person
2. Handwriting style of an individual person also varies time to time and is inconsistent
3. Poor quality of the source document/image due to degradation over time
4. Text in printed documents sit in a straight line whereas humans need not write a line of text in a straight line on white paper
5. Cursive handwriting makes separation and recognition of characters challenging
6. Text in handwriting can have variable rotation to the right which is in contrast to printed text where all the text sits up straight
7. Collecting a good labelled dataset to learn is not cheap compared to synthetic data

### What we do ...

1. Take input image. 
2. Process through OCR and HTR algorithms to recognize the handwriting. 
3. Thus , we have our Handwritten to text converter .
4. Furthermore we will store and create a font based on the input taken.
   - We can take another input from the user and by studying those we can create a font of user's handwriting.
   - we can also use default text.
5. Based on this font we can also achieve text to handwritten as we'll just be changing the font.
6. Our app will also include all symbols and mathematical equations which a drawback of some algorithms.

### OCR VS HTR

|     OCR     |     HTR     | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus on single characters, so no context is used |	Focus on both single characters ánd context (sentence-based with an n-gram)|
| Preferably clear background	| Preferably clear background, but focus on the text-regions (difficulties on blank pages) |
| Sudden language/ character changes can cause trouble |	Sudden language/ character changes can cause trouble |
| Trained – fixed – tool |	You create a ground truth and can create a model fitting for your text |

### Neural networks

- Neural networks are a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of an animal brain to recognize relationships between     vast amounts of data.

- As such, they tend to resemble the connections of neurons and synapses found in the brain.

- Neural networks with several process layers are known as "deep" networks and are used for deep learning algorithms.
